          <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
          <p> Hey! I am a 28-year old who loves Tech, WWE and Cricket! Although I was born and brought up in Allahabad, India, I completed my graduation in Electrical Engineering in Banglore, India. After that I spent 3 years working as an Admin Manager in Allahabad. This is when I thought to pursue MBA and spent one eventful year in Singapore. Realising my passion for tech, I came to Canada to learn and work in the IT field.  </p>
